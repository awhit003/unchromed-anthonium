# Project Specification: unchromed-anthonium

1. Project Goal

To create a personalized fork of the open-source Chromium web browser. The fork will be named "unchromed-anthonium". It will maintain feature parity with Chromium while incorporating custom and unique user interface and privacy enhancements.

2. Current Status & Base

Base Code: The main Chromium repository source code has been checked out (src/ directory is locally available).

Development Platform: macOS (using depot_tools).

Target Platforms: macOS, Windows 11.

Build State: Build environment is configured and ready for the initial gn gen and autoninja process.

3. Immediate Technical Task

The immediate goal is to successfully execute the first build of a rebranded application, "unchromed-anthonium," from the Chromium source, similar to how other projects like ungoogled-chromium manage their initial differentiation. This involves identifying and modifying all necessary resource files to change:

The application name.

The application icon.

The internal browser strings.

4. Planned Future Features

Once the basic fork is stable and rebranded, the following features will be integrated in subsequent phases:

uMatrix-style Content Filtering: Advanced, granular content blocking and filtering controls, requiring deep integration into the browser's networking and rendering pipelines.

Lynx-style Rendering: The browser will offer an optional, lightweight text-rendered mode for use inside the terminal, prioritizing speed and accessibility over visual fidelity.

5. Endstate Vision

The final product will be a fully functional web browser that can be launched directly from the command line using the custom command ua (or similar, if ua is reserved) in both macOS (zsh) and Windows 11 (PowerShell) environments.

# Third-Party Notices

This project customizes and redistributes components from the Chromium open-source project.

Chromium and its bundled third-party libraries are governed by a collection of permissive
licenses (primarily BSD-style) located in the upstream source tree (e.g., `LICENSE`,
`third_party/*/LICENSE`). When incorporating upstream code, retain all existing header
comments and ensure any modified files preserve their original license notices.

Additional third-party components introduced into this repository will have their
respective licenses documented below or in a dedicated subdirectory.

## Upstream References
- Chromium master license: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/LICENSE
- Individual third-party licenses: Located under `third_party/` in the Chromium source tree.

## Added Dependencies (None yet)
_No additional third-party software beyond Chromium has been added at this time._

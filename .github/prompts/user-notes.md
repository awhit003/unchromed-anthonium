Good morning,

I will start by reminding you that you are:

- an instance of GitHub Copilot
- inside VS Code on the machine addressed as `folly`
- accessing the local `C:\GameServer\sunshine-service\sunshine-service.code-workspace` workspace
- the workspace rests on this windows 11 pro game machine known as `folly`.
- Your terminal is what I like to call "full fat" `powershell`
  - powershell 7.5.3
  - attached to the file system of `folly` with full read/write access
  - `Folly/Anthony` is in the Administrator group
  - the Administrator group on `folly` has full disk access, and
  - you are logged in as `folly/Anthony` on the local `folly` file system in your terminal.

VS Code even says [Administrator] in the title bar.

> Try to not break the file system of `folly`

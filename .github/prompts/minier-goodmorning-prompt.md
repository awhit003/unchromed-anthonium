
Good morning,

I will start by reminding you that you are:

- an instance of GitHub Copilot
- inside VS Code on the machine addressed as `minier`
- accessing the local `/Users/first/Developer/unchromed-anthonium/unchromed-anthonium.code-workspace` workspace

- Your terminal is what I like to call "lite" `pwsh`
  - powershell core 7.5.3
  - attached to the file system of `minier` with full read/write access
  
- you may be asked to run remote commands via SSH as the `folly/yep` user to the remote `folly` host's file system using your terminal.

- `Folly/yep` is in the Administrator group
- the Administrator group on `yep` has full disk access, so

> Try to not break the file system of `folly`

Good morning,

I will start by reminding you that you are:

- an instance of GitHub Copilot
- inside VS Code on the m1 macOS machine addressed as `mini`
- accessing via SSH the remote `C:\GameServer\sunshine-service\sunshine-service.code-workspace` workspace
- the workspace rests on the windows 11 pro game machine known as `folly`.
- Your terminal is what I like to call "full fat" `powershell`
  - powershell 7.5.3
  - attached to the file system of `folly` with full read/write access

> Try to not break the file system of `folly`

Good morning,

I will start by reminding you that you are:

- an instance of GitHub Copilot
- inside VS Code on the machine addressed as `minier`
- accessing via SSH the remote `C:\GameServer\sunshine-service\sunshine-service.code-workspace` workspace
- the workspace rests on the windows 11 pro game machine known as `folly`.
- Your terminal is what I like to call "full fat" `powershell`
  - powershell 7.5.3
  - attached to the file system of `folly` with full read/write access
- `Folly/first` is in the Administrator group
- the Administrator group on `folly` has full disk access, and
- you are logged in as `folly/first` on the remote `folly` file system in your terminal.

> Try to not break the file system of `folly`

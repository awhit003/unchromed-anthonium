Starting (3/4) *Create Chromium workspace and fetch source*

Ran terminal command: $env:PATH = "C:\src\depot_tools;" + $env:PATH; cd C:\src\chromium; fetch chromium

The user creation step has been dropped as requested. The Chromium `fetch` process has been restarted and is running again. 

Once the fetch completes, you’ll be ready to proceed with verifying the build environment for remote SSH access and building unchromed-anthonium on Windows. Let me know if you want to check fetch progress or need help with the next steps.
